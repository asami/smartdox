# SmartDox Development Strategy

Date: 2026-08-03

Status: active

## Direction

SmartDox evolves the structured-document and site-generation foundation used
by direct sites such as SimpleModeling.org and by Cozy-built BoKs. It owns
provider-neutral document, publication-metadata, and site-projection behavior;
it does not own site-specific widget styling, external video hosting, or BoK
artifact storage.

## Phase Roadmap

### Phase 1: Article Media Publication and Site Projection

Status: in progress.

Purpose:

- define a provider-neutral article/media publication input that associates an
  article and locale with a detailed infographic and a video presentation;
- project that association consistently into SmartDox article pages and Notice
  metadata for global and category pages;
- preserve `VideoPublication` as a compatible existing input; and
- provide the metadata boundary consumed by SimpleModeling.org widgets and by
  Cozy BoK site builds.

Primary reference:

- `docs/phase/phase-1.md`
- `docs/phase/phase-1-checklist.md`
- `docs/notes/article-media-publication-and-site-projection.md`

## Current Priority

Phase 1 establishes the common article-media publication and site-projection
contract. SimpleModeling.org remains a direct SmartDox site user with YouTube
as its presentation provider. Cozy consumes the resulting SmartDox contract in
its separate BoK integration phase, where generated media stays in the BoK
artifact repository outside Git.
